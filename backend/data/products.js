Cases of COVID-19 range from mild to severe. Most people infected with this virus have mild symptoms. Some people who are infected donâ€™t have any symptoms and donâ€™t feel sick but can still transmit the virus to others. More severe cases of COVID-19 have been seen in older adults and those with weakened immune systems or pre-existing health issues. However, serious illness can also occur in younger adults..IMPORTANT: Please seek immediate medical care if you have signs of a serious medical condition.These include, but are not limited to, persistent fever (lasting longer than 48 hours) greater than 102Â°F or a persistent low-grade fever, severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, continuous pain or pressure in the chest, severe coughing spells or coughing up blood, irregular heartbeat, confusion, blue lips or face, dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling too weak to stand, feeling very tired or lethargic, slurred speech or seizures, persistent vomiting or diarrhea, or feeling not well enough to stay home.Fees and Payment:INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE COVID-19 TESTING FULLY PAID BY THEIR HEALTH PLAN OR THE GOVERNMENT, WITH NO OUT-OF-POCKET COST, WHEN BILLED TO THE HEALTH PLAN OR THE GOVERNMENT.

This testing can also be used to identify individuals who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 or have no known exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but who are unknowingly infected.You are trying to determine if a prior infection with COVID-19 has resolved.This test may NOT be helpful if you:Currently have severe symptoms that limit your daily activities. Seek medical attention right away if this is the case. Have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 3 months. When you test positive, you will not need to be tested again for 3 months, as long as you do not develop new symptoms.

Understanding your results -> If your results are positive, it is important to contact your healthcare provider immediately, self-isolate, and monitor your symptoms.If your results are negative, you were most likely not infected with COVID-19 at the time of sample collection. However, it is important to note that in some cases there is not enough SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the sample to detect the virus.This can happen in a certain percentage of cases during the stages of infection. If you are experiencing symptoms, it is important to follow up with a healthcare provider for further evaluation, and to take protective measures to avoid infecting others.',

    name: 'Covid-19 Antibody Blood Test',
    image: '/images/basichealth.jpg',
    description: 'This blood test, which is authorized by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)*, is designed to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (this is not a test meant for detecting an active infection**). Antibodies are proteins that the body produces in response to infections. The antibodies can be produced even if a person has few or no symptoms during the infection.For the safety of our patients and employees, we have limited appointment times for the COVID-19 Antibody Test at our Patient Service Centers.This test does not require fasting and is only available for persons 18 years of age or older.About COVID-19 Antibodies: It generally takes 1-3 weeks (sometimes longer) after an infection for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to become detectable in the blood. There is not enough evidence to know whether having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 will prevent reinfection or if the virus is no longer present. Antibodies are generally detectable in the blood for a period of time after a person has recovered from the infection. Whether you have been tested for infection or antibodies, recovered from an active infection, or have had no symptoms at all, COVID-19 is highly contagious and youshould take preventive measures to protect yourself and others.We do not know yet if people who recover from COVID-19 can get infected again. Scientists are working to understand this.Currently, the FDA supports antibody testing with the following important points: Antibody tests can play a critical role in the fight against COVID-19Testing can help identify who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 infection, and potentially developed an antibody responseRight now, it is unclear whether individuals who have antibodies may be less susceptible to reinfection. In the future, broad use of antibody tests and clinical follow-up will provide more information on this pointMultiple sources, including the CDC and healthcare experts, recommend you discuss your test results and whether to return to work with your healthcare provider.If you were never diagnosed with COVID-19, this test can help determine if you may have been previously infected with the virus.If you were diagnosed with COVID-19, this test can check whether or not your body has produced antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Fees and Payment:INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE COVID-19 TESTING FULLY PAID BY THEIR HEALTH PLAN OR THE GOVERNMENT, WITH NO OUT-OF-POCKET COST, WHEN BILLED TO THE HEALTH PLAN OR THE GOVERNMENT.

Additionally, if you test too soon, your body may not have produced enough IgG antibodies to be detected by the test yet, which can lead to a false negative result.This test may NOT be helpful if you: Are feeling sick or have had a fever within the last 1-3 full days, please contact a healthcare provider Think you are currently infected with COVID-19, please contact a healthcare provider Were tested with the COVID-19 Active Infection test and were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 10 days Were infected with COVID-19 in the past 14 days Have a compromised immune system or have a condition that makes it difficult to fight infections For the latest information on COVID-19, please visit our website for information for patients.*About the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Status This test has been authorized by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). This means that while Quest Diagnostics has validated the test and has the data to believe the test and the collection kit are accurate, this test has not been FDA- cleared or -approved; This test has been authorized by FDA under an EUA for use by authorized laboratories; this test has been authorized only for the detection of IgG Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, not for any other viruses or pathogens; and, this test is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use on in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 under Section 564(B)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360BBB-3(B)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.Additional studies need to be conducted for this test and others like it to be FDA cleared or approved.**The antibody test is not meant for detecting an active infection.
